Station, short for monitoring station, is a monitoring point in your location. 

When attaching a hardware monitor to a station, the station will keep a copy of all the monitor data being recorded. If the station needs a new monitor because the previous monitor was broken, a new monitor can be easily swapped in without losing any of the previous monitor's data for this station.

In the near future, the station will allows users to mix and match multiple monitoring parameters into one station.

## Accessing Stations   

Stations are part of a Location, so stations can only be accessed in a Location.
   
You can find your Station in the left sidebar in the Location display page. The drop-down list shows all the stations in this location.
