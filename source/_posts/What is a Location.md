Location is the visual and virtual representation of a space. Locations allow you to set up the space and include the relevant monitors for the space to organize and calculate the information to be displayed in data tables and graphs. Locations must be long to a Workspace. 

Note that without Hardware or monitors attached to your Location, the Location will be an empty shell with no data. To learn how to add Hardware to the Location, click [here](/Adding-Hardware-to-a-Location).

## Accessing your Locations

You can find your Locations in the left side bar. There will be a Locations link for each Workspace. To browse all accessible Locations at once, you can access the Locations link under the "All" Workspace.

## Location Display Page

The Location Display Page is the display page for the location. The display page is good for displaying on tablets or TVs to show indoor air quality information of the space.

The left side shows all the latest information, with a Location Logo, Location Name, Station Name, City, Last Updated time, and then indicators that are selected to be shown on the Display page.
