When signing in, the first page you see is your Dashboard.

The Dashboard is a place where you can choose to pin the Location Average readings or a specific monitor's readings from a Location to get a quick glance at your most frequented Location's status.

###  How to Add to your Dashboard

When you first start, you will have nothing in your Dashboard.  To add, there are two options: add from your Locations or add from Public Locations.
