## Instructions for Connecting DST Monitor: OCP2000v1 to Qlear 

#### Step:
1. Let's first test the monitor. The monitor should have a red light if it's connected to power. And when you press the button on the back of the monitor, there should be a flashing green light.  
 - Note: Make sure that your monitor has a flashing green light when you click on the button. Otherwise, it might be an older version that will not work.
