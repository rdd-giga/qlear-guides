There are two types of Locations in QLEAR: Indoor and Outdoor. 

## Indoor locations

Indoor Locations are representative of indoor spaces. Indoor Locations can select Outdoor Locations to be used to compare the two to determine the difference between indoor and outdoor air quality. We use BTO (Better than Outside) to represent this.

## Outdoor locations

The Outdoor Locations is designed to represent Outdoor spaces. The monitors attached to this Location should be monitoring outdoor data. Outdoor Locations are different from Indoor Locations because they can be chosen to be the Outdoor Location to be used for comparison with an Indoor Location.

## Configuring a Location to be Indoor or Outdoor
