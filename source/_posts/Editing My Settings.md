My Settings contains 3 pieces of basic information for your account:

- PM2.5 Settings
- Temperature Unit
- Notification Frequency

The **PM2.5 Settings** is used to choose Concentration or AQI. It allows the user to choose exactly what system of measurement they want for their experience in QLEAR.  
The **Temperature Unit** option allows the user to select Celcius or Fahrenheit to be used across the platform.  
The **Notification Frequency** allows users to choose how often they get their Notifications from QLEAR.

## 1. Go to the My Settings Page
