## Workspace Permission Options

There are two permission options:

- **Admin**  
  Users with Admin permissions in the workspace

- **Regular**  
  Users with Regular permissions in the workspace 

## How do I get permission to access the Workspace?  

There are two scenarios for getting the permission to access the Workspace.

**1. You are the founder of this workspace.**  Learn more at [Creating a Workspace](/Creating a Workspace)

**2. Be invited by others who have the permission** Learn more at [Inviting users to your Workspace](/Inviting a User to your Workspace)

## Troubleshooting

**Why do I not see "Overview" on the left bar?**  
If you do not see "Overview" in the left bar, that is because you do not have Admin permission in the workspace. Please check your account to see that you have the right permissions. There is also a chance that you might be signed in to the wrong account.
