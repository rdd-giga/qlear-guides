The QLEAR User Guide will answer any questions you have about QLEAR.

## What is QLEAR?

QLEAR is a platform for storing and displaying data about your working environment. This includes things like air quality, light and noise data, electricity use, etc. QLEAR provides both web and mobile applications to view and share the data to many different audiences.

To get started, refer to the steps below:

## 1. Signing in to QLEAR

To use QLEAR you'll need to have compatible, internet-connected monitor(s) online and configured to send data to QLEAR. We are hardware agnostic and support many different types of meters. Once your monitors are online, configuring QLEAR is easy.

First you'll need to create an account and sign in. Upon successfully signing in, you'll be taken to your Dashboard. This is where you'll be able to see important locations and meters at a glance once you've finished configuring QLEAR.

For more instructions on Signing In, please click [here](/How-to-Sign-In).

## 2. Creating a Workspace

Next, you'll create a workspace. 

Workspaces are the first level of organization, where you and add and remove users, set permission and visibility levels, etc. Typically this is named after the company or institution.

For more information on how to Create Workspaces, click [here](/Creating-a-Workspace). For more about Workspaces, please click [here](/What-is-a-Workspace%3F).

## 3. Add Monitors to your Workspace

Once your workspace is created, you'll want to claim your monitors. 

Follow the steps for adding monitors to your Workspace as outlined [here](/Adding-Hardware-to-QLEAR).

## 4. Allocating your Monitors to a Location

Now that you've got your Workspace set up and your monitors claimed in your Hardware inventory, you now can create your Locations and begin attaching their respective monitors. 

To do so, first, [Create a Location](/Creating-a-Location). After that, [Add Hardware to a Location](/Adding-Hardware-to-a-Location).

## 5. Adding a Location to your Dashboard

Finally, you can add your preferred locations to your Dashboard to make it easier to access your Location.

For more information on the Dashboard, click [here](/Using-the-Dashboard).

## 6. Closing Notes

With that, you've completed the initial steps to getting started with QLEAR. Navigate around your workspace to see all the features in action! This is by no means the limits of configurability or features in QLEAR, so be sure to see the other guides in our knowledge base for more info on how to best use QLEAR for your needs.
