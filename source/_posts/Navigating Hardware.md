There are two main parts to navigating the Hardware Display page: 

- **Display Area**
- **Function Button**

## Display Area

In the left side of the page is the display area which shows all the Hardware's latest data. 

At the top, there is the ID number of the specific hardware along with the brand. Under that includes real time data of all the relevant parameters to this piece of hardware.
