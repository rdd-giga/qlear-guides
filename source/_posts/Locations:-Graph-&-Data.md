- **1. Graph**
- **2. Table: Every Hour**
- **3. Table: Raw Data**
- **4. Calendar**

## 1. Graph

Graph displays hourly data of the Location in a graph. The graph shows either the Location Average or a specific Station at any one time. In addition, the user has the option of selecting which parameter and timeframe to display.

If your workspace is a PRO workspace, you can see the graph setting:
  
- Indicator: Select from available Indicators.
- Range: Select the timeframe of the graph. *Exact date filter is available to Admin Only*.  
- Hours: Select working hour/ non-working hour/ both to show in the graph. *Admin Only*.
- Other Stations: Select the stations you want to compare, up to 5 stations. *Admin Only*.
- Health Standards: Select the health standards you want to have.

## 3. Table: Raw Data

Table: Raw Data is the same as Table: Every Hour, except it displays the raw data directly from the hardware it references. A select date filter is available and for data in previous months, a user can download the data as a .csv via the Download Data button.  

Note that the "Location Average" station will never have Raw Data as it is aggregated hourly.

## 4. Calendar

The Calendar provides a way to visualize your data for indoor air across every day in a year. Each day is calculated as a daily average. IAQ reports will be based on the same values.
