## Connecting Monitor OPC2000v1 to Wifi 

### Determining that you have a OPC-2000 v1 Monitor

All OPC-2000 v1 monitors will have a red light on the back of the monitor when plugged in.

### Preparation

First, download the DST Wifi App (currently only available for Android) from this link:  
https://cloud.gigabase.org/index.php/s/CRueBJYwAcNoxLS

### Steps to connecting the monitor to WiFi

1. Place the DST air monitor within range of the wireless signal (the closer, the better).
Confirm that your monitor is connected to a power source and turned ON (which is indicated by the red light in the back of the monitor).
    
2. Connect your phone to the WiFi that is to be connected to the monitor.
Then, open the ‘DST WiFi ‘ app and your WiFi name will already be there.
Enter your WiFi password in the lower space.
  
3. Look for the reset button at the back of the DST monitor.
Click on the reset button for 1 second.
Wait 5-10 seconds and then on the ‘DST WiFi’ app, click the ‘Start adding device’.

**Note:** There are two versions of v1. If holding the button at the back does not work, then the monitor you have might be a v0. Reseting a v0 monitor requires you to plug in and unplug the power 3 times at  second intervals. It goes like this: plug-in the power, one second, unplug the power, one second, plug-in the power, one second, unplug the power, one second, plug-in the power.

4. Your phone should now be trying to help the DST monitor connect with the internet.

5. If it is successful, you will get a success message and MAC address of the monitor. If it’s not successful, please refer to the troubleshooting guide on the next page.  
After it is successful, you will not need to do this again until you switch SSID and password.

6. Now that you’re connected, you can begin making sure that the data is successfully being transferred to QLEAR, the software you will be using to display your data.
