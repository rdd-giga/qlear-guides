All OPC-2000 v2 monitors will have a red light on the back of the monitor when plugged in. In addition, when you press the button on the back of the monitor, there should be a flashing green light.

### Steps to connecting the monitor to WiFi

1. Plug in the electric power for the monitor. The monitor should have a red light if it's connected to power.
    
2. Find the “reset” button on the back. It's the only button on the back.
  
3. Press the “reset” button for 6 seconds. When you press the button on the back of the monitor, there should be a flashing green light.

**Note:** make sure that your monitor has a flashing green light when you click on the button. Otherwise, it might be an older version that will not work.  

4. Open the Easy Link Lite App, click the  "+" button on the top right corner.

5. On your phone with the app, connect to the Router that you want to connect the Monitor to. Make sure the router is 2.4GHz.  
On the app, enter the SSID and password of the router, then click "Fast Mode".
