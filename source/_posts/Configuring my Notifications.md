Notifications are emails that are sent to you with details on Locations that you are following. Notifications can be set for each Location.

To set up a notification, follow the steps below:

## 1. Notifications for a Location

Go to a Location, then find the Location Notification button via the blue circle on the bottom right.

## 2. Set up Notifications

You can now set up different notifications for the Location Average based on hourly averages, including:

- **Stale Notification**  
  If the location is not receiving data after a certain period of time, a stale alert will be sent.
- **Over Repeat Notification**  
  If the monitor is sending the same reading for 6 hours, then an alert will be sent.
- **Reading Limit Notification**  
  Reading Limit allows the user to set Min or Max limits for the different parameters
  i.e. When the PM2.5 reading is higher than 50ug/m3, you will receive a Email.
