Your Profile contains 3 pieces of basic information for your account:

- Email
- Name
- Mobile Number

The **Email** is used to send email notifications and is also your QLEAR username.  
The **Name** allows QLEAR to know what to call you.  
The **Mobile Number** is something we hope to implement soon, where you will be able to receive notifications via text message.

If you need to update your profile, follow the following steps:  

## 1. Go to the Update Profile Page  

On the top right corner, find "Welcome". Click on that to display a dropdown with the link "Update Profile".
