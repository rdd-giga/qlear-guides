### How do you move a monitor from one workspace to another workspace?

To move a monitor from one Workspace to another Workspace, find the monitor in question and find the "Edit Monitor" link. Then change the Workspace to the right Workspace.

It is required that you are an Admin of both the Workspace that currently has the monitor and the Workspace that you want to move it to.
