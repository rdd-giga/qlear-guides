For Locations to work, you must add Hardware to it first. Below are the steps to adding a monitor to your Location.

Note that this is accessible to Admins of the Workspace only.  

## 1. Edit Location 
 
First, go to the Display page of your Location. Then, click on the blue circle button on the bottom right, "Edit Location".

## 2. Station

Click on the "Station" tab in the Edit Location page. 

If you already have a Station available, skip to the next step. If the Station you want is not yet available, create one by clicking on "ADD STATION" to add a station.

Give your new Station a name, which will be displayed in the Location Display page on the top of the left bar.

## 3. Station - Visibility

There is a slider button in the top right corner of the Stations box. Admin users can decide whether this station is displayed in the left bar.

If you want to go to the invisible station page, you could go to [Show Stations](/Stations:-Show-Stations) 

## 4. Station - Primary Indicator

You could choose a primary indicator which will be the top indicator shown in the station display page.

## 3. Select monitor 

Now you could be able to add a monitor. You will need the monitor ID, which is selectable in the dropdown. The pre-requisite is that the monitor already belongs in the Workspace. Besides the monitor, there are also indicators which show on the Location Display page.

## Location Average

The Location Average is the default monitor that is shown for the Location. It calculates an hourly average of all the monitors in the Location, regardless of whether it is visible or not.

If you do not want the Location Average to show for this Location, set the Location Average's visibility to "Hide".
