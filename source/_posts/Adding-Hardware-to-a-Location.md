## 2. Monitors

Click on the "Monitors" tab in the Edit Location page. Click on "Add Monitor" to add a monitor to your list. You will need the monitor ID, which is selectable in the dropdown. The pre-requisite is that the monitor already belongs in the Workspace.

Besides the monitor, there is also:

- **Station Name** - how the monitor will be named in the Location Display page.
- **Visibility** - whether or not to show the monitor on the Location Display page.
- **Indicators** - which indicators to show on the Location Display page.

## Location Average

The Location Average is the default monitor that is shown for the Location. It calculates an hourly average of all the monitors in the Location, regardless of whether it is visible or not.

If you do not want the Location Average to show for this Location, set the Location Average's visibility to "Hide".
